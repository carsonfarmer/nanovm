# Issues

One list of known problems (`N-n`) and planned work (`W-n`), so nothing is done twice or missed. Before starting one, set its status to `fixing` (or `in progress`), with who has it, and push; when it is on `main`, set `fixed in <commit>` (or `done in <commit>`) in the same push. New problems get the next `N-` number, new work the next `W-` number.

- **Reproduced**: shown against the real code or the OS. **From source**: traced through the code, not run.
- Status: `open`, `fixing`, `fixed in <commit>`, or `deferred: <why>`.

## Problems

Found by the review at `c607ec9`, unless an entry says otherwise; line numbers are as of that commit.

### N-1: a registry app's egress list can name private and loopback addresses
- **Where:** `egress.rs:26-28`, `egress.rs:313-314`, `config.rs:128-136`, `supervisor.rs:322,333`
- **Scenario:** An IP-literal egress rule skips the public-address filter, because the operator is assumed to have written it. For a registry app the tenant writes it: `Limits::clamped` keeps the app's own `egress`. A signed `nanovm.json` naming `127.0.0.1:<port>` or `169.254.169.254` reaches the host's private network, including the node's front end, where the app can send the proxy-only headers and switch another app name to a version it signed.
- **Reproduced:** no (from source)
- **Fix:** refuse non-public IP literals in tenant-supplied egress lists. Once local apps are gone, that is every list, and the exemption in `egress.rs` can go (the egress integration tests that allow `127.0.0.1` need another upstream).
- **Status:** fixed in bbeb543

### N-2: the worker's syscall filter allows every `fcntl` command
- **Where:** `jail.rs:131`
- **Scenario:** `F_SETOWN` with `O_ASYNC` (and `F_SETSIG`) on a descriptor a worker holds makes the kernel signal a process of the worker's choosing when I/O arrives; the kernel checks only that the uids match. When the supervisor isn't root, workers share its uid, so code that got out of Wasm can stop the supervisor and other apps' workers.
- **Reproduced:** yes (the mechanism, at the OS level, against a throwaway process)
- **Status:** fixed in 62c9edf

### N-3: manifest digests become cache paths unchecked
- **Where:** `registry.rs:151`, `registry.rs:187-193`
- **Scenario:** `blob` reads `cached(&d.digest)` with a digest taken from the manifest; `path` only replaces `:`. A tenant-signed manifest with digest `sha256:../../<path>` makes the supervisor read any file it can (or `/dev/zero`) and hand it to the tenant's worker. Cached reads also skip the hash check.
- **Reproduced:** no (from source)
- **Status:** fixed in bbeb543

### N-4: registry downloads have no size limit
- **Where:** `registry.rs:139-145`, `registry.rs:154-156`, `registry.rs:168-173`
- **Scenario:** The manifest, blobs, referrer manifests and Sigstore bundles are buffered whole in supervisor memory; referrers and bundles are fetched before verification, from a repository the tenant controls. One deploy can exhaust the supervisor's memory.
- **Reproduced:** no (from source)
- **Status:** fixed in bbeb543 (size caps) and db99779 (signatures counted per bundle); the overall deadline per fetch came with N-22

### N-5: a failed `rmdir` is still journaled
- **Where:** `quota.rs:476-478`, `journal.rs:186-191`, `journal.rs:267`
- **Scenario:** `RemovedDir` is recorded before the removal, without checking that an empty directory is there. When the removal fails, rollback creates a directory that never existed and that the file count never charged; repeated, it takes the volume past `max_files`.
- **Reproduced:** yes (journal compiled alone in a scratch harness)
- **Status:** fixed in 5f79152

### N-6: an inode is marked as size-recorded before the record is written
- **Where:** `journal.rs:155-158`
- **Scenario:** `sized.insert(ino)` runs before `record(Undo::Size(..))`. When the record fails (journal full), the retry skips it, and rollback can't undo the file's growth.
- **Reproduced:** yes (scratch harness)
- **Status:** fixed in 5f79152

### N-7: undo bytes are read through the guest's own descriptor
- **Where:** `journal.rs:162`
- **Scenario:** Overwriting a file opened write-only fails with `EBADF`, because the old bytes are read with `read_exact_at` on the guest's descriptor.
- **Reproduced:** yes (scratch harness)
- **Status:** fixed in 5f79152

### N-8: truncating an open file after unlinking it credits its bytes twice
- **Where:** `quota.rs:588-592`, `journal.rs:108-115`, `quota.rs:123-133`
- **Scenario:** Unlinking moves the file into the journal and credits its bytes. `local_file` still accepts the file there, so `set_size` credits them again. Repeated, committed data exceeds `disk_mb`.
- **Reproduced:** no (from source)
- **Status:** fixed in 60c46ed

### N-9: a failed `wasi:keyvalue` set keeps its quota adjustment
- **Where:** `kv.rs:118-123`
- **Scenario:** `reserve` changes the counters, then the journal steps can fail with a non-trap error (journal full); the reservation is never undone and the counters drift from the volume.
- **Reproduced:** no (from source)
- **Status:** fixed in 734468c

### N-10: eviction can drop an object that still has queued work
- **Where:** `table.rs:195-207`, `table.rs:150-151`
- **Scenario:** `evict_lru` picks entries whose phase is `Idle`, which an entry still is with a job queued but not yet received, or a WebSocket event waiting in the spawned send. The evicted actor drains its queue while the next request starts a second actor for the same object on the same volume.
- **Reproduced:** no (from source)
- **Status:** fixed in f98cb9a

### N-11: cancelling a version switch mid-drain can leave two workers on one app's volumes
- **Where:** `supervisor.rs:334-337`
- **Scenario:** The old `Live` is taken out of `w.live`, then the drain is awaited. If the request future running `start` is dropped meanwhile, the old worker keeps serving in-flight bodies while the next request starts a new worker.
- **Reproduced:** no (from source)
- **Status:** fixed in bbeb543

### N-12: a WebSocket path with two leading slashes is registered to the wrong object
- **Where:** `supervisor.rs:174`, `supervisor.rs:205`
- **Scenario:** The app is found after trimming every leading `/`, the object with `split('/').nth(2)` untrimmed: for `//counter/alice` the object is `counter`.
- **Reproduced:** no (from source)
- **Status:** fixed in bbeb543

### N-13: a worker can open any number of links to the supervisor
- **Where:** `link.rs:191-195`
- **Scenario:** Every fd sent on a control socket becomes a served connection, with no limit. A worker can make the supervisor hold any number of connections (each one a pending outbound request), and the worker-side outbound limit (`egress.rs:140`) is only enforced inside the worker.
- **Reproduced:** no (from source)
- **Status:** fixed in e410377; the cap is per worker and large (5,000 links by default), with nothing across the node: see N-27

### N-14: publish bodies are collected with no deadline
- **Where:** `ws.rs:407`
- **Scenario:** The supervisor collects a publish body up to `response_max` with no time limit; a worker that sends part of one holds that memory for as long as it likes, per link (see N-13).
- **Reproduced:** no (from source)
- **Status:** fixed in e62e9ac: proxy publish collection and supervisor forwarding have 30 s deadlines. N-13 (e410377) previously bounded memory per link, but not duration.

### N-15: forwarded responses have no body timeout
- **Where:** `egress.rs:281-285`, `egress.rs:367-369`
- **Scenario:** `serve_forwarded` bounds connecting and the first byte, but nothing bounds the response body after it, so a slow upstream holds the supervisor's connection and link for as long as it trickles.
- **Reproduced:** no (from source)
- **Status:** bounded by N-13 (e410377): a trickling body still holds its link, but the number of links a worker holds is now capped

### N-16: worker stderr without newlines grows one buffer without limit
- **Where:** `supervisor.rs:402-407`
- **Scenario:** The supervisor reads each worker's stderr with `lines()`; a worker that never writes a newline grows the line buffer until the supervisor runs out of memory.
- **Reproduced:** no (from source)
- **Status:** fixed in bbeb543 (lines capped at 4 KiB); no test, which needs a worker that misbehaves on purpose

### N-17: a warm worker is reused without checking the request's trust policy
- **Where:** `supervisor.rs:265`
- **Scenario:** The running worker is matched by digest alone, so a request naming the same digest with a different `nanovm-trust` or a higher `nanovm-min-version` is served unchecked. Matters only if the proxy sends different policies for one app name.
- **Reproduced:** no (from source)
- **Status:** fixed in bbeb543

### N-18 (efficiency): the registry copies every blob it stores
- **Where:** `registry.rs:206`
- **Scenario:** `store` returns `bytes.to_vec()`, a second copy of the component on every cache miss.
- **Reproduced:** no (from source)
- **Status:** fixed in bbeb543

### N-19 (efficiency): registry cache I/O runs on the front-end runtime
- **Where:** `registry.rs:191-207`
- **Scenario:** `cached` and `store` use blocking `std::fs` on the single-threaded front-end runtime, stalling every request on that thread while a component is read or written.
- **Reproduced:** no (from source)
- **Status:** fixed in bbeb543

### N-20 (efficiency): WebSocket fan-out scans every socket
- **Where:** `ws.rs:409`
- **Scenario:** Each publish walks all of the worker's sockets to find its object's; cost grows with the app's sockets, not the object's.
- **Reproduced:** no (from source)
- **Status:** fixed in bb8a418: the proxy's single socket tree is keyed by object and connection id; fan-out visits only that object's sockets, without a second index.

### N-21: jailed workers can't use a relative `data_dir`, so the demo fails
- **Where:** `object.rs:287`, `jail.rs` (the seccomp allowlist)
- **Scenario:** `new_store` canonicalizes the object's directory, and with a relative `data_dir` (the demo's `../nanovm-data`) that reads the cwd. `getcwd` isn't on the worker's allowlist, so every instantiation fails with `ENOSYS` and the demo answers `503 instantiate-failed` to everything. The tests use absolute paths, so they pass. Found running the demo while fixing N-2.
- **Reproduced:** yes (`demo/demo.sh`, and strace showing the refused `getcwd`)
- **Status:** fixed in d7f7ee6

### N-22: nothing bounds how many apps a node runs (high; blocks a public proxy)
- **Where:** `supervisor.rs:154` (the worker map), `registry.rs` (`Registry::load`)
- **Scenario:** since phase 7 the public names apps: any domain's TXT record, and with apps keyed by host, every host is an app of its own. Each new app gets a worker process, a uid, directories and a cgroup, and nothing caps them or removes them; worker-map entries (and their failure records) are never dropped. Loads aren't limited across apps either, and `read_timeout` is per read, so a registry trickling a byte every 29 s holds a load (up to `max_component_mb` of memory) for as long as it likes. A wildcard DNS record makes this free.
- **Reproduced:** no (found by reading, in the phase 7 review)
- **Fix:** a node `max_apps`, with idle workers exiting and leaving the map (else the cap is a permanent denial of service); a node-wide semaphore around `Registry::load`; an overall deadline per load.
- **Status:** fixed in add9b68

### N-23: a dev-mode node behind the proxy is reachable from the public
- **Where:** `config.rs` (`dev_on_loopback`)
- **Scenario:** dev mode requires a loopback `listen`, but a node behind the proxy listens on loopback anyway (the proxy's default `node` is `127.0.0.1:8080`). A dev-mode node there runs unsigned apps with private egress for anyone the proxy routes.
- **Reproduced:** no (phase 7 review)
- **Fix:** refuse dev mode in release builds (`cfg!(debug_assertions)` or a cargo feature), or document that it holds only while nothing forwards to the node.
- **Status:** fixed in 80cd5b6: dev mode needs the `dev` cargo feature (off by default); tests enable it through a self dev-dependency, the demo builds with `--features dev`

### N-24: the proxy (and the node) exit on an accept error, and the proxy has no handshake or header timeouts
- **Where:** `proxy.rs` (`serve`: `listener.accept().await?`, `tls.accept`), `server.rs:30`
- **Scenario:** at the fd limit, `accept` fails with EMFILE and `serve` returns, ending the process; about 1,024 idle TCP connections do it at a default soft limit. `tls.accept` has no timeout, and without a hyper timer there is no header-read timeout.
- **Reproduced:** no (phase 7 review)
- **Fix:** log, sleep about 10 ms and continue on accept errors; `timeout(10 s)` around the TLS accept; a `TokioTimer` and a header-read timeout on the proxy's connections.
- **Status:** fixed in 087db11 (the node's front end shares the accept fix; its test drives the proxy)

### N-25: the proxy's caches are unbounded and not single-flight
- **Where:** `proxy.rs:48-49` (`routes`, `digests`), `route`, `digest`
- **Scenario:** every distinct `Host` costs a DNS-over-HTTPS query and an entry that is never removed (a wildcard record makes it free); errors aren't cached, so a bad record is asked about on every request, inviting the resolver to rate-limit the proxy; a popular host's expiry sends a burst of identical queries.
- **Reproduced:** no (phase 7 review)
- **Fix:** drop expired entries past a size limit when inserting; cache errors briefly; one lookup in flight per host.
- **Status:** fixed in 3c8b418

### N-26: a running app's accepted policies grow without bound
- **Where:** `supervisor.rs:101`, `supervisor.rs:213-218` (`Live.policies`)
- **Scenario:** each distinct `(trust, min)` a request names is re-verified over the network (holding the app's start lock) and kept once accepted; varying `min=` or adding junk `trust=` entries grows the set and costs a referrers fetch each time.
- **Reproduced:** no (phase 7 review)
- **Fix:** clear the set past about 16 entries.
- **Status:** fixed in 0571c92

### N-27: links are capped per worker only, and high
- **Where:** `link.rs:192-201`, `supervisor.rs:328`
- **Scenario:** the N-13 cap is `max_live_objects × (max_outbound_concurrency + 1)` per worker, 5,000 by default, with nothing across the node. A worker that got out of Wasm can hold 5,000 to 10,000 supervisor fds (links plus upstreams); past the supervisor's fd limit, its accept loop fails and the node exits (N-24).
- **Reproduced:** no (phase 7 review)
- **Fix:** a node-wide semaphore shared by every `link::serve`, sized from the fd limit, or a much smaller per-worker cap.
- **Status:** fixed in c23cd12

### N-28: a drain doesn't wait for the old worker to be gone
- **Where:** `supervisor.rs:519-525` (`drain`)
- **Scenario:** `drain` drops the kill sender but doesn't wait for the process to exit, so the next worker can start on the same volumes a moment before the old one is dead.
- **Reproduced:** no (phase 7 review; predates phase 7)
- **Status:** fixed in 04d2e62; no test, since SIGKILL ends the old process far faster than a new worker starts, so the race can't be made to fail on demand

### N-29 (efficiency): uid lookup and chown run on the front-end thread
- **Where:** `supervisor.rs` (`uid`, `chown_tree`)
- **Scenario:** blocking filesystem walks on the single-threaded front end stall every request on that thread while a worker starts.
- **Reproduced:** no (phase 7 review; predates phase 7)
- **Status:** fixed in 04d2e62 (a latency change, no test)

### N-30: the proxy doesn't strip hop-by-hop headers
- **Where:** `proxy.rs` (`forward`)
- **Scenario:** `Connection`-listed and other hop-by-hop headers from the client are forwarded to the node. Low risk (the node is HTTP/1.1 and strips its own headers), but a proxy should drop them.
- **Reproduced:** no (phase 7 review)
- **Status:** fixed in ca4f51e

### N-31 (removable): code the phase 7 review found removable
- **What:** `check_digest` in `AppRef::from_headers` repeats the one in `fetch`, which runs before any path (1 line); TLS in the proxy (`proxy.rs` `tls`, `tls_cert`/`tls_key`, about 30 lines) if a terminator in front is assumed (owner's call: there is no ACME anyway); depending on `oci-spec` directly instead of oci-client, which the runtime now uses only for its re-exports (fewer dependencies, not lines).
- **Status:** partly done in 57d17a4: the runtime depends on `oci-spec` instead of oci-client (10 fewer crates in the runtime build; three small serde structs read the manifest fields it needs). The `check_digest` in `from_headers` stays on purpose: Reference parsing accepts upper case and other algorithms, and the early check answers a malformed digest with a 400 before any start lock or registry work. Its last part, dropping TLS from the proxy, is W-14 (decided).

### N-32 (tests): two integration tests failed once on a cold first run
- **Where:** `tests/integration.rs:1335` (`registry_app_switches_versions_after_a_drain`, first request not 200), `tests/integration.rs:1515` (`the_journal_is_out_of_reach_and_works_from_a_relative_data_dir`, killed for using more than 100 ms of CPU)
- **Scenario:** in the first full run after rebuilding, at 7ea5e8e, both failed (and at add9b68, `data_quota_survives_restart`, `tests/integration.rs:438`, an in-process test); alone, and in two more full runs, they passed. Likely load while components compile (the CPU budget is tight for a first request on a busy machine) plus network for the ghcr.io test, but the cause isn't confirmed.
- **Reproduced:** once, not on demand
- **Status:** partly fixed in d64c80a: the in-process quota tests failed when the full suite loaded the machine enough that a 4 MiB write passed `hostile`'s 100 ms CPU budget (wall time inside guest polls; the journal test's failure said so). They now use a `filler()` app with 1 s, as `file_count_limit` already did. The ghcr.io test's one failure is unexplained (likely network); open for that. Still seen once after that: `a_failed_requests_writes_are_rolled_back` (`tests/integration.rs:1498`, its first `/commit` on `hostile`) on the first full run after a rebuild, at the N-23 commit; the commit tests could use `filler()` too, but their `then=spin` case expects a CPU kill, so check the status it gets with a 1 s budget. Seen again at the W-15 commit in `the_journal_is_out_of_reach_and_works_from_a_relative_data_dir` (`tests/integration.rs:1520`); the commit and journal tests are now the ones that flake.

### N-33: initial proxy DNS lookups have no deadline
- **Where:** `proxy.rs`, `forward` → `resolve` → `lookup`
- **Scenario:** a resolver that accepts but never answers holds the initial HTTP request or WebSocket handshake before socket admission. W-3's event-delivery timeout does not cover that initial lookup. Predates W-3; found by its adversarial review.
- **Reproduced:** from source, not a live stalled-resolver test
- **Status:** open; bound the initial lookup and add a stalled-resolver test

### N-34 (tests): forged worker publish identity lacks a direct regression test
- **Where:** `supervisor.rs`, the egress link's publish branch
- **Scenario:** W-3 constructs fresh publish headers and stamps the worker's app, ignoring any worker-supplied `nanovm-app`, including duplicates. The review found no runtime flaw, but the normal-guest isolation tests do not exercise a compromised worker forging those headers.
- **Status:** deferred: source-reviewed boundary is correct; a malicious-link harness is needed without changing guests. Do not weaken the supervisor stamp when refactoring.

### N-35: persistent object directories exhaust filesystem link limits
- **Where:** `object.rs`, `new_store`; `demo/demo.sh` creates a fresh set of 5,000 object IDs each run
- **Scenario:** every persistent object volume is a direct child of the app directory. Repeated demos reached 65,000 directory links on this orb; new objects fail with `instantiate-failed` while existing objects work, despite free disk/inodes and live-store capacity. Eviction does not delete persistent volumes.
- **Reproduced:** yes: `stat` reports 65,000 links on the counter app directory and a direct `mkdir` fails with `Too many links`. The first affected demo had seven cold-start failures; the next had 65,000 instantiation failures. Existing solo/canary objects still answered. This predates the telemetry response changes.
- **Status:** open; plan directory sharding/data lifecycle without deleting existing volumes. W-2 validation uses a fresh disposable data root and preserves the exhausted directory.

### N-36: jailed-worker telemetry drops spans under sustained HTTP load
- **Where:** worker SDK export queue and supervisor relay; fixed by W-2, delivered on main in `49d0ae4`.
- **Reproduced:** oha 1.16.0 sent three 200,000-request runs through the real supervisor/jailed-worker path to OpenTelemetry Collector 0.164.0. All HTTP requests succeeded at 35–39k/s, but only 406,006/600,000 request spans reached the Collector. Its accepted/sent counts matched and refusal/failure counts were zero; the worker reported a full SDK queue. Even a 20k/s rate-limited run lost 2,439/200,000 spans.
- **Experiments:** 512-span batches reduced loss but did not eliminate it; two front-end threads also still lost spans. The SDK's experimental async processor with two concurrent exports delivered all 600,000 at 28–33k/s, but failed the strengthened flush barrier test. These experiments are not retained; do not claim the earlier 75–79k/s in-process result establishes production-path capacity.
- **Latency investigation:** mean worker export round trip 14.86ms, of which stamping was 0.68ms; Collector HTTP await was 9.40ms including scheduling. Lowering Tokio's I/O event interval did not help and was reverted. Stable concurrency 64 delivered 200,000/200,000 spans at 21,833 requests/s; concurrency 256 delivered 166,452/200,000 at 26,112/s. Next distinguish supervisor scheduling delay from Collector service time. These are session-specific observations, not a guaranteed capacity.
- **Scheduling fix:** the CLI now creates the supervisor on a dedicated one-thread control runtime; startup tasks use its captured Handle rather than the originating frontend. Relay/reaper/export I/O no longer competes with requests on frontend zero. Measured worker export round trips fell from 12.6 to 3.5 ms; the same front-thread-one workload that lost spans delivered all spans in three runs afterward. The frontend-lifetime regression fails when startup uses the old runtime. No custom exporter or queue/batch/sampling change.
- **Sustained validation:** 2,000,000 HTTP200 requests at 25,282/s, p99 28.6 ms, delivered 4,000,000/4,000,000 spans to official Collector 0.164.0 with derived metrics enabled; accepted/sent counts match and refusals are zero. Three preceding 200k runs also delivered all 400k spans each. This repairs the reproduced loss, not all overload/outage loss. The requested 64k HTTP target remains unresolved; historical main's confirmed 64k figure is in-process, while its HTTP rate is 27–29k on this orb. See HANDOFF for matched controls and CPU/timing evidence.
- **Status:** fixed in W-2, delivered in `49d0ae4`. Q71 accepts the separately budgeted Collector deployment; earlier measurements above are historical. Bounded best-effort export remains independent of request success; no lossless-accounting or universal capacity promise.

### N-37: final post-return commit failures lose diagnostic classification
- **Where:** `object.rs`, the final `commit(acc).await.is_err()` in `serve`
- **From source:** after sending a successful response, a failed final commit marks the request span as error but discards the I/O error and supplies no `error.type` or failing-phase classification. The initial commit has a `commit-failed` classification; the final one should be equally diagnosable without changing the already-sent HTTP status.
- **Status:** fixed in the focused W-2 continuation: retain the I/O result, record `post-return-commit-failed` and a bounded correlated diagnostic, preserve HTTP status. A gated test-only component outside `guests/**` proves actual post-return calls/logs and fails the second commit by moving its journal log. The regression failed before the fix; the full locked suite passes. Published guests remain unchanged.

## Planned work

Agreed with the owner on 2026-10-30; PLAN.md's "Roadmap" has the order and the reasons, HANDOFF.md the decisions (Q41–Q51).

### W-1: per-object SQLite demo (priority)
- **What:** a guest where every object is its own SQLite database on `/data`, committed with its response, and a demo that shows it (for example a room or a ledger per object, with a crash mid-request rolled back). The showcase for nanovm.
- **Where:** `guests/` (a new guest), `demo/`, README. Adding or changing guests triggers `publish-guests.yml` on push to `main`, which publishes new versions: ask the owner first.
- **Status:** open

### W-2: OpenTelemetry by default; deprecate the stats and events APIs (high priority)

**Delivery:** done in `49d0ae4bf6e3d336fab8415f68aa7faa15782c81` on main. Main CI 41543687359 and branch CI 41543685753 passed. No production deployment, guest changes or package publishing. The owner-requested simplification follow-up is in progress on `w2-docs-simplification`: subagent owns telemetry/egress runtime code; parent owns docs and combined validation. Baseline 5,315 runtime lines; preserve behavior, safety bounds and performance.

**Complete (Q71):** owner delegates deployment to engineering. Recommend a separately budgeted standalone/gateway Collector, or dedicated physical cores on the same host. The measured 2.17% application overhead satisfies that deployment's gate; 7.58% colocated overhead and 13.62–14.70 µs/request additional Collector CPU remain explicit costs. Runtime 5,315 versus baseline 4,955 (+360, 7.3%). Correctness, complete exports, full suites, mutations, production check, demo, quick benchmark and CI pass. No guest changes or LOC-only refactor. Remote-machine and durable-backend performance are not tested; operators must validate their backend/topology. Earlier pending-decision checkpoints below are superseded; proceed with validated fast-forward delivery.

<details>
<summary>Historical W-2 checkpoints — superseded by the delivery record above</summary>

**Current delivery/acceptance:** implementation and validation preserved on `w2-observability`, not merged. Post-commit controls at `9b8f8fb`: main/W-2 18,631/18,227 requests/s with equal application physical-core allocation and separate Collector/load-generator cores (2.17% lower); 27,548/25,459 fully colocated (7.58% lower). Active application CPU 103.45/105.00 µs/request isolated, 109.42/110.64 colocated; Collector adds 14.70/13.62 respectively. All 2.4m spans in each matrix and all 4m in a sustained 2m-request run arrived. Long-path/tracestate/overload exports also complete. Full locked suite passed twice (104 unit, 67 integration, one ignored), production check/demo/quick benchmark/mutations pass. Owner decision on separate Collector CPU budgeting remains; do not infer acceptance of the colocated cost. No span consolidation, sampling or guest changes. HANDOFF records the executable recipe and both favorable and unfavorable earlier results.

**Final optimization / Q70:** owner requires all meaningful supervisor/worker/proxy/dependency spans; the consolidation proposal below is rejected. Native profiling identified repeated pure OCI parsing. A bounded per-thread cache (16 owned inputs ≤1024 bytes) leaves all per-request trust/host/version/digest checks intact; common span attributes avoid reallocation. Three matched 400k-request pairs measure 0.74% lower aggregate throughput than main with Collector physically isolated, 4.45% lower fully colocated. Every expected span arrived (2.4m per matrix), with all HTTP200 responses. Cache-bound/key mutations were caught, full locked suite and production check passed; demo passed 70k requests and contained 100 attacks with zero canary failures. Runtime 5,315 lines; no guest modifications. Post-commit repetition/final delivery remain. HANDOFF has exact measurements and retained prior evidence.

The checkpoints below are historical, not outstanding product decisions.

**Post-commit CPU isolation:** acceptance is within a few percent of matched main, not 64k over HTTP. On `1adadcc`, six warm 200k-request runs per variant with application and Collector on separate physical cores measured aggregate main 13,001 versus W-2 11,635 requests/s (10.5% lower). Application CPU 147.0→165.2 µs/request; Collector 23.45 µs/request separately. All 2.4m W-2 spans arrived for 1.2m HTTP 200 responses. Thus the remaining gap is not solely colocated Collector CPU. A diagnostic omission of supervisor-hop events improved 2.6–8.7% in earlier matched rounds but removes coverage and is not retained; batch1024 had inconsistent throughput and risks oversized exports. Independent node-ingress latency versus consolidating successful hop events is the remaining proposed product tradeoff. Preserve all coverage until decided; W-2 remains unmerged and its performance gate open. HANDOFF records CPU topology, raw results and reproduction.

- **Latest continuation:** post-return and front-door coverage, control-runtime isolation and an official Collector reference pipeline are implemented. Full locked suite, mutation checks, production build, demo and quick benchmark pass. Real Collector-derived request/error/histogram counts are verified; a sustained 2m-request HTTP run exports all 4m spans. The remembered ~64k main benchmark is reproduced in-process; full-export W-2 is 75–78k there, not over HTTP. Final alternating clean-build HTTP controls are main 23.8–25.2k versus W-2 17.2–23.3k, with all spans delivered. Do not discard the slower runs or claim the performance gate is cleared; branch unmerged.
- **Focused continuation:** N-37 and actual post-return call/log verification are implemented. Proxy/supervisor request events cover pre-worker rejections and propagate context into the worker. Full locked suite passes (104 unit, 67 integration, one ignored). N-36, mutation/review follow-through, production validation, demo and benchmark remain; no merge. The owner rejects a ~22k complete-export operating envelope as the resolution; measure matched HTTP throughput and full export against the requested ~64k target.
- **Review checkpoint (Q69):** cancellation before headers now marks dependency spans as cancelled; external error classifications ignore upstream private headers; runtime diagnostics carry explicit request context. Regressions failed before each fix. User requested stopping at this checkpoint. N-37, actual post-return call/log attribution, pre-worker coverage and N-36 remain; do not merge or mark W-2 complete.
- **External HTTP coverage:** CLIENT spans and SDK W3C propagation now cover external guest requests, including denied calls and handled 4xx/5xx responses. Queries are excluded from spans and denial logs. Local-upstream regression failed before implementation and checks actual received context plus decoded OTLP. Pre-worker coverage, final review and N-36 remain unfinished.
- **Correctness first (Q68):** owner suspended LOC enforcement and asked for Honeycomb-guided instrumentation before optimization. Main's journal changes through `40c5895` are integrated. Inter-object spans now record CLIENT kind, target, method/path, status and errors; request spans use SERVER kind. Regression covers success, callee trap, cycle rejection and 404 with concurrent independent traces. Remaining coverage: external HTTP client spans/context injection, pre-worker proxy/supervisor failures, post-return/background attribution and boundary privacy. Preserve standard SDK batching and configurable Collector; N-36 remains open.
- **Production-path validation:** N-36 records the real-Collector gap. The existing jailed-worker test now checks four concurrent requests queued on one caller, each retaining its own caller → call → callee trace parentage. The queue test also requires flush to wait for in-flight exports; it rejects the concurrent SDK experiment. Runtime remains 4,993 lines; no experimental runtime or dependency changes are retained.
- **Allocator/export milestone (Q66):** Linux CLI/benchmark use library jemalloc; embedders keep allocator choice. Runtime 4,993 lines, no new instrumentation framework. A deterministic stalled-export test failed with the old queue (1280/1792 delivered); a 2048-span queue retains that burst while dropping overload at its bound. `bench --export` checks decoded spans and drain time: three runs received 601,000/601,000 at 75–79k/s. Full suite passes (94 unit, 65 integration, one ignored). Remaining: production-path throughput, main comparison, concurrency/parentage coverage and adversarial review; no merge yet.
- **Log-path simplification:** 4,999 → 4,990 runtime lines by removing redundant log/event wrappers; guest correlation, field names and body bounds are unchanged. Allocator and full-export burst experiments continue; W-2 remains unmerged.
- **Runtime budget / response milestone (Q65):** 5,016 → 4,999 runtime lines with the unchanged count. Preserve trace detail and snapshot fields; simplify SDK conversion, response plumbing and snapshot ownership. Direct and worker-link transports now return bounded Collector status/body to the SDK, whose existing parser reports partial rejection through stderr diagnostics. Validation is recorded in HANDOFF; W-2's throughput, further concurrency/parentage coverage and review gates remain open.
- **Current owner-approved migration (Q62):** in progress by Amp on `w2-observability`. Always-on event-oriented instrumentation replaces the tracing feature and metric exporters: rich request spans, correlated logs, periodic infrastructure snapshot events, configurable OTLP collector. Phase detail stays on the request; analytics and sampling belong downstream. The earlier metric/feature milestones below are historical. Guest API work is W-17.
- **Event-model milestone (Q63):** implemented with OpenTelemetry SDK spans/logs/batching, no custom event framework. One actor-owned request span survives post-return commit; phase fields and exact guest-log correlation are tested, including unsampled incoming parents and restart context. Metric exporters/local histograms and the tracing feature are removed. Full serial suite passed (92 unit, 65 integration, one ignored). Matched long probes did not demonstrate a throughput win: preceding W-2 median 65,604/s versus events 64,309/s; main comparison 84,518/s versus events 64,245/s. No merge; final mutation/demo/benchmark follow-through and remaining W-2 correctness/review gates are recorded in HANDOFF.
- **Complete-export measurement (Q64):** the owner accepts roughly 64k/s with full observability and prioritizes simplicity. An active local decoding sink exposed 37–38% dropped request events with 64-span SDK batches. Batches of 256 (same queue/body caps) and stamping only at the worker trust boundary delivered all 601,001 events repeatedly, mostly at 50–54k/s. Keep the library-based simplification, but do not call the no-listener 64k result full observability. Further throughput work remains; do not increase complexity merely to chase noisy orb numbers.
- **What:** OTel traces (a span per request, with queue wait, instantiation, guest time, commit, calls), metrics (what `/_nanovm/stats` reports today) and guest logs (each object's stdout and stderr), on by default and tagged with app, object and version. Then remove `/_nanovm/stats` and `/_nanovm/events`.
- **Design notes:** a jailed worker can't open sockets, so its telemetry has to leave through the supervisor, over the egress link or its stderr; the supervisor exports OTLP to an operator-configured collector. Look at the `opentelemetry` and `tracing-opentelemetry` crates before designing. Touches the supervisor, so coordinate with the rewrite.
- **Where:** `metrics.rs`, `object.rs`, `server.rs`, `supervisor.rs`, `demo/demo.sh` (it reads `/_nanovm/stats`).
- **Status:** in progress by Amp on `w2-observability` (2026-10-31), incorporating main's enabled CI. Readiness is independent of telemetry (Q57). Bounded SDK/OTLP transport, supervisor identity stamping, request spans, worker counters and guest logs are implemented (Q58–Q60); real jailed-worker exports and adversarial relay tests pass. Consumer migration/API removal is complete. Remaining: collector error reporting, further hostile load/trace-parentage coverage, review and resolution of the performance gate. HANDOFF records the checkpoint and successor prompt. No guest changes.
- **Landing blocker:** transport CI/full suite/demo pass, but default full-trace warm GET throughput regresses. Removing synchronized span wrappers improves the measured 36,897/s to 44,546/s, still below main's 72,863/s on this orb. Sampling and phase-event experiments were not retained. HANDOFF records seven caught mutations and benchmark caveats. Do not mark W-2 done or merge until the performance requirement is resolved.
- **Performance investigation / Q61:** repeated 200,000-request warm probes isolate span recording and batch handoff as the main overhead, not metrics alone. Five spans are recorded per ordinary warm request (including both commits). The owner requested an optional compile-time switch: `tracing` is default-on; `--no-default-features` retains metrics/logs without recording spans. Full tracing remains unchanged in detail, and its performance blocker is not waived. Async SDK batching, shared object strings, larger batches and boxed spans did not improve the repeated comparisons and were reverted.
- **Retained optimization:** preallocate room for the request span's response status instead of reallocating at completion. Alternating warm comparisons improved about 50k→54k requests/s with full detail; no sampling change. Trace-free builds measured 63–68k/s. Remaining full-tracing overhead is still a landing blocker.
- **Worker coverage:** runtime event logs, instantiation histograms and phase gauges now export and pass the real jailed-worker test. Supervisor worker state, starts/link errors, RSS and uptime also export. Tests and demo consume OTLP; stats/events APIs, event ring and JSON serializers are removed. Shutdown exports pending signals off the async runtime thread. A 4,096-object regression caught batches exceeding 1 MiB at the original 2,048-series cap: Q60 reduces it to 512 plus overflow while preserving totals. Collector response/error reporting, stronger concurrency/trace coverage and final review/performance validation remain outstanding. Latest full suite: 94 unit, 65 integration passed, one ignored. Latest quick warm GET: 41,849/s, still below the baseline.

### W-3: move WebSockets into the front proxy
- **What:** the proxy holds client sockets, Pushpin-style, and sends each event to the object as the plain `POST` it gets today; publishes go to the proxy. Most of `ws.rs` leaves the node, and the node only answers requests. Resolves N-14 and N-20. Supersedes Q31.
- **Where:** `proxy.rs`, `ws.rs`, `supervisor.rs`, `egress.rs` (`hold`), `object.rs` (`commit`), the WebSocket tests.
- **Status:** done in e62e9ac (migration), bb8a418 (cleanup). Runtime 4,247 baseline → 4,264 implementation → 4,246 cleanup. Full suite passed twice: 93 unit, 64 integration, one ignored; seven mutations caught and restored cleanly. Demo: 70,000 normal requests succeeded, 100 attacks contained, canary zero failures. Quick benchmark has mixed small variation and unchanged 96 KB/object density; HANDOFF records numbers and limitations. Adversarial review found no confirmed runtime blocker; identity test gaps fixed, N-33/N-34 recorded. Guests unchanged.

### W-4: alarms, outside the node
- **What:** a scheduler beside the proxy. An object sets an alarm with a response header; when it fires, the scheduler sends the object a request. Durable across restarts of the scheduler; the node is unchanged.
- **Status:** open, soon after W-3

### W-5: data lifecycle (planning)
- **What:** a plan for deleting an app's or an object's data, exporting a volume, backups and retention, and how each is authorized (likely through the proxy).
- **Status:** open

### W-6: JS and Python guests
- **What:** guests built with componentize-js and componentize-py, running the same endpoints as `counter`, to prove the host for other languages.
- **Status:** open

### W-7: `nanovm publish`
- **What:** one command that pushes an app with `oras` (layout as in `publish-guests.yml`) and signs it keylessly (`cosign` with a browser sign-in, or a CI attestation).
- **Status:** open

### W-8: benchmarks against workerd and Spin
- **What:** density (memory per object), cold starts and warm latency against workerd (Durable Objects) and Spin, on the same machine, with the method written down.
- **Status:** open

### W-9: research: change records shipped off the node
- **What:** whether a commit can emit a self-contained record of what it changed (the journal already knows the touched paths) and ship it to replicated storage, Litestream-style, so a node is a cache of its volumes. Survey Litestream, LiteFS and Durable Objects' storage design first.
- **Status:** open

### W-10: groundwork for many nodes
- **What:** a lease hook before instantiation in `table.rs` (always granted on one node), an epoch carried by each commit, request ids so the proxy can retry safely. Placement belongs in the proxy.
- **Status:** open, after W-3

### W-11: run requests that don't write in parallel
- **What:** stateless routes on any node, and read-only requests on read replicas of an object. On one node, a reader beside the writer would see uncommitted data (the undo journal writes in place), so replicas need committed state: a snapshot, or W-9's change records. Whether a request writes isn't known in advance, so routes would be declared read-only, with `/data` mounted read-only to enforce it.
- **Status:** open (research)

### W-12: trusted caller header on calls between objects
- **What:** the node sets `nanovm-caller: <id>` on calls and strips it from client requests, so an object can serve internal endpoints only to its app's objects. Left out of the first version because testing it needs a guest that echoes headers (a guest change; see W-1's note on publishing).
- **Status:** open

### W-13: removable code in the rewrite's files
- **What:** from the review's list, for the agent rewriting these files: drop the registry's manifest cache and the SHA-256 re-check in `Registry::store` (oci-client already checks digests) and its `to_vec` copy (N-18); drop the `memory_mb <= memory_reservation_mb` checks in `config.rs` (the pool and the limiter already enforce both). Keep the digest-format check of N-3. Owner's call, smaller: stop forwarding the guest's connect and first-byte timeouts, the fs-denied event throttle, the worker-side `well_formed` check on publishes.
- **Status:** done: the config memory check is gone (f56887e). The registry half no longer applies: with our own registry client (phase 7) its hash check is the only digest check, so it stays, and the manifest cache went with db99779

### W-14: drop TLS from the proxy (owner decided 2026-10-30)
- **What:** remove `proxy::tls`, the TLS branch of `proxy::serve` (and its handshake timeout), `tls_cert`/`tls_key` in `ProxyConfig`, the `tokio-rustls` dependency if nothing else uses it, and the TLS half of `the_proxy_outlasts_idle_and_excess_connections`. TLS is left to a terminator in front (Caddy, a cloud load balancer, Cloudflare), which also handles ACME and certificate reloads that the proxy never had. It is in git history if wanted back. Update README's "The proxy".
- **Status:** fixed in f49077f

### W-15: key apps by the DNS name that owns their record (owner decided 2026-10-30)
- **What:** today an app is keyed by the request's host and repository, so `example.com` and `www.example.com` are two apps with separate data. Key it instead by the name whose `_nanovm` TXT record was found, after CNAMEs: the `name` of the TXT answer in the DNS-over-HTTPS JSON, lowercased, without a trailing dot or the `_nanovm.` prefix. The proxy sends that as `nanovm-host`. Then `_nanovm.www.example.com CNAME _nanovm.example.com` makes both hosts one app. Still safe: a CNAME to someone else's record only serves their app as their record configures it, which anyone could already reach through their own domain; no name can choose another name's version or data. Test with the DoH stub answering a CNAME chain (two hosts, one app; a third host with its own record, its own app). Update README's "The proxy" and "Apps", and Q52 in HANDOFF.
- **Status:** fixed in 54054c0

### W-16: build and test CI
- **What:** run a production-feature build check and the unit/integration suite on pushes and pull requests; build guests locally without publishing packages. Read-only token, Ubuntu 24.04, locked dependencies, serial test scheduling to reduce N-32 contention.
- **Status:** done in d6f89f9, runner fd-limit correction in 57d1595. GitHub run 41227208960 passed: production build check, 93 unit and 64 integration tests, one ignored. Workflow checks are enabled; no branch-protection rule was changed.

### W-17: guest instrumentation API
- **What:** let guests enrich their request event and create child spans using propagated context. Survey existing WASI/OpenTelemetry interfaces before introducing a custom API. The host owns app/object/version identity, bounded fields/events and the collector destination; guest input must not spoof identity or cross request/tenant boundaries.
- **Status:** follow-up requested by the owner; outside the W-2 event-oriented host migration. Guest changes require explicit approval before editing or publishing.
